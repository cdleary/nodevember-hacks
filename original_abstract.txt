Runtime Funtimes: pushing the limits!
 
"JavaScript is the universal runtime." I know I've heard people say that... but
what /is/ a runtime? Why would I want one? It sounds exhausting, does it come
with an exercise video? And why is this talk's title obnoxiously implying that
the one I've got isn't good enough?
 
In this talk we will explain why runtimes are where the Turing Tarpits break
down. (Or boil up, or something.) Touching on both client- and server-side
tech, we’ll explore cutting-edge techniques for runtime betterment:
DSLs, language-hosted FFI support, and get down to bare-metal performance
brass-tacks — how fast can we get the server side to go? If you've never
believed the "JS can be like LISP" baloney, you're gonna walk out singing the
Oscar Myer Weiner song.
